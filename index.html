        <h2><b>Appendix G. Automatic File Download at Console Log On</b></h2>
        <p>This appendix describes how files are downloaded from the server to the console when the console signs on to the server.</p>
        <p>The installation of the NetView management console topology console occurs in the following two phases:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>During the installation process</li>
            <li>The first time the console logs on to the server</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>During Installation</h2>
        <p>During the installation process, the smallest possible set of files is installed on the local workstation. This includes the following types of files:</p>
        <p>v NetView management console topology console code</p>
        <p>v MRI (readable strings) for the appropriate language</p>
        <p>v A subset of background, help, and icon files</p>
        <p><b>Note: 
</b>The exception to the rule of installing the smallest possible set of files on the workstation during installation occurs when a custom install is performed and the Productivity Kit is selected. This installs all files necessary to run the NetView management console topology console in demonstration mode (not requiring a NetView management console topology server).</p>
        <h2>During Initial Sign On</h2>
        <p>The first time the console signs on to the server following installation, files are automatically downloaded from the following server directories:</p>
        <p>v   For Windows systems: %BINDIR%/TDS/server/db/current/</p>
        <p>v For AIX or Linux systems: </p>
        <p>$BINDIR$\TDS\server\db\current These directories and their </p>
        <p>descriptions follow:</p>
        <p><b>backgrounds</b></p>
        <p>View background maps/images</p>
        <p><b>bin</b>NetView management console topology console binary support files including scripts</p>
        <p><b>icons	</b>Resource and company icons</p>
        <p><b>help</b>Online help support files including:</p>
        <p>v NetView management console product specific help files</p>
        <p>v    Customer Java application help files</p>
        <p><b>lib</b>Java code including the following files:</p>
        <p>v    NetView management console topology console Java code (ihseuc.jar) v   NetView management console product personality file (nmc.properties) v Customer Java application and plug-in JAR files</p>
        <h2>During Subsequent Sign On</h2>
        <p>The files downloaded during the initial sign on are automatically checked for updates each time the console successfully signs onto the server. That is, when the console downloads a file, the console stores the time stamp of the file on the server workstation. If the time stamp has changed, the file is downloaded again.</p>
        <p>If the console connects to the same server, these files are updated only when changes have been made. However, if the console connects to different servers on different platforms, the time stamps across servers is close, but not identical.</p>
        <p>Therefore, a value in the defaultscheme.properties file can be set so that you can control exactly when the download occurs. This control applies when reconnecting to the same server or to different servers. See “Customizing the Automatic Download of Files At Log On” on page 29 for more detailed information.</p>
        <p>The lib directory is handled differently than the others. Files installed by the Console, and named in the contents.properites file in the lib directory, are only downloaded if a different build of the Console is placed in this directory. That is, the time stamps of these files are not cross-checked. The time stamp cross-check does occur for files in the lib directory which were provided by the customer.</p>
        <p>However, the defaultscheme.properties file has not yet been read in; therefore control over when these files are downloaded cannot be customized. See the defaultscheme.properties file for more information and for the internal value that the Console uses for the time stamp cross-check.</p>
        <p>When a file in the lib directory needs to be downloaded, message IHS1137 is displayed and the file must be downloaded before sign on can continue. These files might need to be reloaded into memory. For files in all other directories, the file is downloaded and sign on processing continues automatically.</p>
        <p>
See Appendix B, “Topology Console Commands,” on page 123 for more information about command-line arguments to suppress this downloading process.

        <h2>Appendix H. MultiSystem Manager Resource Information Window–Other Data Field for the Open Topology Interface Agent</h2>
        <p>This appendix lists the MultiSystem Manager resource types for the MultiSystem Manager Open Topology Interface and the contents of the Other data field for each resource type.</p>
        <p>The following table contains the contents of the Other data field in the NetView management console Resource Information window for each of the MultiSystem Manager resource types. This data is stored in the DisplayResourceOtherData field in the Resource Object Data Manager (RODM) for each object.</p>
        <p>If more than one field is listed, the fields are listed in the order in which they are displayed.</p>
